# Cancer-Classification-And-Interpretability-Using-Explainable-AI
Show drafts    Imagine fighting a monster (cancer) with detective work (traditional diagnosis). It works, but it's not perfect. This project uses a super-smart brain (AI) to analyze pictures and spot the monster early. The cool part is, the AI explains its reasoning, highlighting suspicious areas, just like a good detective showing their clues! 

Cancer diagnosis is a cornerstone in the fight against this multifaceted disease. Traditionally, this process relies heavily on human expertise and invasive procedures. While these methods are crucial, they can be subjective and have limitations in early detection. This project ventures into the exciting realm of deep learning for cancer classification. Deep learning models, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, have revolutionised various fields, including medical imaging analysis. Creating AI systems that offer intelligible and transparent justifications for their choices is the primary goal of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). When it comes to medical imaging-based cancer detection, XAI technology employs sophisticated image analysis techniques such as deep learning (DL) to assess and interpret medical pictures while offering a transparent account of its reasoning. This includes giving information about the underlying AI algorithm and decision-making process utilised, as well as emphasising certain regions of the image that the system identified as suggestive of malignancy. However, their "black box" nature, where the rationale behind predictions remains opaque, can be a hurdle in healthcare applications.We compare the performance of three pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs): VGG-16, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV3, on a dataset containing images from eight different cancer types obtained from Kaggle. We evaluate each model's effectiveness in classifying these cancers using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, we utilise explainable AI (XAI) techniques like Grad-CAM++ to visualise the regions of interest within the images that contribute most significantly to the model's predictions. This visualisation improves the interpretability of the model's decision-making process, aiding medical professionals in understanding the rationale behind the classifications.
