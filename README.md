# Cancer-Classification-And-Interpretability-Using-Explainable-AI
Show drafts    Imagine fighting a monster (cancer) with detective work (traditional diagnosis). It works, but it's not perfect. This project uses a super-smart brain (AI) to analyze pictures and spot the monster early. The cool part is, the AI explains its reasoning, highlighting suspicious areas, just like a good detective showing their clues! 

Current Cancer Diagnosis: Relies on human expertise and invasive procedures, which can be subjective and limited in early detection.

Project Goal: Utilize deep learning for cancer classification in medical images.

Deep Learning: Inspired by the brain, it revolutionizes image analysis, but can be a "black box" (lacking clear explanation).

Explainable AI (XAI): Aims to make AI decisions more transparent, including highlighting suspicious areas in images.

Project Focus: Compare three pre-trained CNNs (VGG-16, EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV3) on a dataset of eight cancer types.

Evaluation: Analyze models' effectiveness using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Visualization: Use Grad-CAM++ to show image regions most crucial for the model's predictions, aiding doctor understanding.
